# FireCam
An OpenCV project to build a camera application for efficient storage of video

Firecam is a camera software for surveillance purpose and records camera feed in an
efficient way to save memory. In Firecam feature in software; it will only record the
feed in which any movement is detected to save memory by not storing static feeds. It
also has a feature (Background Extractor) which will help to get an image by
removing moving objects from the video which can be used to track stationary
objects. It has static cam for capturing the image as soon as frame camera feed
becomes stable.
